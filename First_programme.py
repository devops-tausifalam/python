print(types)  # This will print the types of num1, num2, and 42
print(float(num1 / num2))  # Perform and print the division as a float

#Program 2: this program returns number of char in the first variable with/without spaces
# I prefilled this variable for you, you don't need to touch it.

whetting_your_appetite = "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms."
